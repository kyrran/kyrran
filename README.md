ðŸ˜„ I'm Kangle, currently pursuing an MSc Computing in Visual Computing and Robotics at Imperial College London. I graduated with First Class honors in BSc Computing Science from the University of Nottingham in 2023 and also spent a semester on exchange at City University of Hong Kong in 2022. These academic experiences have provided me with a diverse perspective on computing, allowing me to adapt to different environments and appreciate various cultures around the world.


ðŸ”­ One of my biggest personal projects is [Learning Tethered Drone Agile Perching](https://github.com/kyrran/gym-pybullet-drones), where I developed a reinforcement learning controller to master agile perching strategies for a tethered drone, specifically using SAC learning from demonstrations. The project includes a complete simulation workflow and real-world hardware experiments, all yielding successful results.

ðŸ”­ Another project is [Teach a Lawnmower How to Write: Building an Obstacle Avoidance System in Multiple Operation Modes]([https://github.com/kyrran/gym-pybullet-drones](https://github.com/kyrran/hrp)) This project delivers an obstacle avoidance system providing varying degrees of user interaction and autonomy for the Husqvarna 430x lawnmower, offering a foundation for future applications in similar products.

ðŸ‘¯ Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me on GitHub for more exciting projects and collaborations!
